# Camilo Catasus Nutshell
## Teamwork description
The first part of this readme will be describing why only my name is on this project.
I will link the github to provide proof, but I've done all of the work by myself.
My partner on the due date of the project informed me that he "was behind in the lectures", and just trying to pass with a D.
So this entire project has been done by myself. That aside, I'll start listing the specifications of my program.


## Features not implemented
* Tilde expansion
* File Name completion
* Metacharacters cannot be in words with \

## Features implemented
* All built in commands, including wildcard matching for cd
* Other commands
* IO redirection for built in commands and other command
* Piping from other commands to other commands
  * The way I read the specifications didn't necessitate printenv or alias to be able to be piped
* Wildcard matching
* Environment variable expansion
* Alias Expansion
